Note: a proper help file will be included in version 0.5

Rationale:  after having tried several wiki vim plugins and several personal wiki workflows, the author realized that:
                 a) full 'wiki' plugins tend to have too many features and impose too many conventions on the user
                 b) no personal note-taking workflow is ever optimal ("never optimal")
                 c) to actually get something written or done, you have to do it NOW (on a Never Optimal Wiki)

Features: 
 - From anywhere within vim: (<l> means <leader>) - all global keymaps can be easily overridden (see configuration at bottom of page)
    <l>ni  goes to main Nerver Optimal Wiki index
    <l>nr  creates new random note (in a predefined 'in' dir)
    <l>nk creates or updates index file in current directory

 -  Within a NOW buffer: (<ll> means <localleader>)
    gf        open dir or file under cursor, adding suffix if needed (vim standard)
    <cr>    same as above (can be turned off to recover default <cr> functionality)
    Ctrl-O go back to previous location (vim standard)
    <ll>cf  create file or dir under cursor,  adding suffix if needed
    <ll>gf  open under cursor with external program, which must be properly declared (see configuration at bottom of page)
                the defaults are 'firefox' for urls and 'mimeopen' for anything else, which should work well in a Linux environment
     -          go up to either dir's index.now file if available or to a netrw view of current directory
    <ll>n    interactively (re)name a (random note) file in place
    <ll>c    interactively classify (move) a file somewhere else, keeping the same name
    <ll>s    copy current file to shadow dir, prepending date to name (to keep a historical log of notes)

 - Minimal syntax highliting:
   ./...    link to another file
   =...=  emphasized text (meant for 'titles')
   *...*   emphasized text (meant for everything else)

Possible usage:
   - dump anything from the mind into a random note ( with <leader>nr from anywhere on vim)
   - occasionally 'process' notes by naming them and placing them somewhere on the directory tree (with <localleader>n and <ll>c)
   - shadow some notes, notably personal writing, to keep a historical log - usually right after naming them (with <localleader>s)

Possible directory tree (besides in/ and shadow/ or equivalent):
   - a 'circulating' dir with subdirs to help temporary notes blend together into something
   - a 'lifehack' dir to contain long-term lifehacking tips
   - a 'quotes' dir to contain notes which carry book quotes, based on post-its glued while reading one
   - etc...

  This could result in the a dir structure similar to the following:
  now/---- in/ ---- random01.now
       |        |-- random02.now
       |        |-- (...)
       |        \-- random15.now
       |-- shadow/ -- (...)
       |-- circulating/ ---- thinking_about_A/ -- (...)  
       |                 |-- (...)
       |                 \-- thinking_about_Z/ -- (...)
       |-- lifehack/
       |-- quotes/ 
       \-- (...)
